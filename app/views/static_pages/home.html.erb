      <h2>For Creators</h2>
      <p>Artists want the freedom to express themselves. Journalists and educators want to honestly relay facts and ideas. With access to a worldwide audience over the internet, our platform allows each of them to be successful without having to compromise their independence.</p>

      <h2>For Consumers</h2>
      <p>The internet connects us to all media. But as businesses decide how to allocate our access in order to maximize profit, they ruin the consumer experience. Let's embrace the open internet instead and give people what they want, when they want and on any device they choose. </p>

      <h2>In the Public Interest</h2>
      <p>The best ideas in our society often challenge powerful interests. These ideas rely on creative independence to first be developed, individual freedom of thought to take root and unbiased systems to be shared widely. We exist to restore and then grow this global cultural democracy.</p>
